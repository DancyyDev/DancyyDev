## About Me

From the time I was young, I grew up playing with legos, creating fun and unique buildings while watching my father, the owner of a dry-cleaners, build and fix old computers in his free time. It intrigued me, and as I got older, I learned how to unassemble and reassemble computers as a hobby while also nurturing my interests in art and graphic design. I took pride in the work I did because I was creating with my own hands. My journey in Resilient Coders has led me to combine my artistic expression and love for computers by allowing me to construct interactive websites that produce engaging experiences for users. It was my love of building and incorporating different mediums that gave me the knowledge to see projects and products with a new perspective, a skill Iâ€™ve found essential to my coding journey. My father taught me that you must work hard in life to get where you want to be. I see how my family puts in the work and they inspire me to do the same. I want to lead by that example and I aim to give 100% in all of my endeavors.
