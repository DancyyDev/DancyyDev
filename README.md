## About Me

I love to build things. I grew up playing with legos, creating fun and unique buildings and things. As I got older, I learned how to build and create designs and as a hobby, build computers. Now my journey has led me to build websites and create fun interactive experiences. It was my love of building and creating things that gave me the experience to see projects and products with a different point of view, searching for problems and then making solutions. The same experience helped me create wonderful re-designs of existing logos and brands such as “David and Dad’s cafe” and “Burn’s Cleaners”. Now as a software engineer, I strive not only for great solutions but for the fine and clean details in the work.
